# LeaguePredictor Improvement Path
This document is a record of the planed improvements to this package. It is meant to be an intorductory tool to tracking the goals and aspirations of the project until (if) the project becomes too large to track the goals and changes from within the same repo.

Please feel free to add ideas or commentary to the improvement ideas listed below.

## Improvement Path
There are several areas of improvement to this code base that we hope to plan for and prioritize, including,
* Formatting/Code Style
* Model Improvement
* Model Extention

Within each of these areas are sub tasks that can be taken on by contributors to the codebase. It will be up to
the user's interest and the priority of the task as to which tasks get done, when.

### Formatting/Code Style
The initial author of this module is relatively junior and so is using this as a learning opportunity. With that in mind, there are several areas of improvement that can be made to the code structure and quality. Some initial changes that should be implemented (in no particular order) are:
* Turning this module into a package and making it availabel on [pypi](https://pypi.org/)
* Remove magic numbers
* Address all typing issues from pylint
* Make the model functions more separated
    * Have them not directly affect the instance dataframe
* General formatting and readability improvements
* Adding testing to run with nox on each push

### Model improvement
* Expand data volume to improve model prediction quality
* Extend data storage type to enable faster processing
* Ways to store the model at the end of training to enable long lived models with prediction comparability
* Establish robust means of making train/test splits in data
* Create metrics to mechanically judge model performance
* Enable dynamic sizing of DNN to minimize CPU and memory while maintaining high performance



### Model Extention
* Enabling the model to train on roles in addition to team data
* Enable the model to train on player/character data
* Enable the model the use real time data/visual data
